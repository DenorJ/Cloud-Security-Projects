Lab 01: Role-Based Access Control using Microsoft Azure

Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using Microsoft Azure.

Step 1: Define Roles and Access Requirements
First, I identify the roles within our organisation, such as Admin, Developer, Auditor, or Network Manager. Then, I determine the specific permissions each role needs.

Step 2: Use Built-In Roles or Create Custom Roles
Next, I check Azure’s built-in roles to see if any of them meet our needs. If they do, I use them. If not, I create custom roles tailored to our requirements.

Step 3: Assign Roles to Users or Groups
I navigate to the Azure Portal and sign in.

I select the resource group, subscription, or resource I want to manage access for.

I click on “Access control (IAM)”.

I click on “+ Add” and then “Add role assignment”.

I select the role I want to assign.

I choose the user, group, or service principal to whom I want to assign the role.

Step 4: Scope the Role Assignment
I specify the scope of the role assignment, such as a specific resource group, subscription, or resource.

Step 5: Verify Access Control Settings
Finally, I test the access control settings to ensure that users have the appropriate access based on their roles. I verify that users can perform the actions allowed by their roles and are restricted from actions not permitted.

Example Scenario
Suppose I want to grant a user named “Joy Grace” the ability to manage virtual machines in a specific resource group. Here’s what I do:

I sign in to the Azure Portal.

I go to “Resource groups” and select the resource group I want to manage.

I click on “Access control (IAM)”.

I click on “+ Add” and then “Add role assignment”.

I choose the “Virtual Machine Contributor” role.

I enter “Joy Grace” in the search box and select him.

I review the assignment details and click “Save” to confirm.

By following these steps, I can effectively implement RBAC in any Azure environment.
