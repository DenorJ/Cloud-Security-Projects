Here's a step-by-step guide to how I completed the tasks for installing Azure Firewall and its advantages for an organization:
Task 1: Use a Template to Deploy the Lab Environment
I started by logging into the Azure Portal.
I navigated to the "Deploy a custom template" section.
I selected a predefined template that included the necessary components for a virtual network with a workload subnet and a jump host subnet.
After customizing the parameters as needed, I deployed the template which set up the environment.
Task 2: Deploy an Azure Firewall
I went to the "Create a resource" section in the Azure Portal.
I searched for "Firewall" and selected "Azure Firewall."
I filled in the required details like the resource group and name, and chose the virtual network created in Task 1.
I reviewed and created the firewall.
Task 3: Create a Default Route
I navigated to the virtual network created in Task 1.
In the "Subnets" section, I selected the workload subnet.
I created a new route table and added a route that directed all outbound traffic to the Azure Firewall.
Task 4: Configure an Application Rule
I accessed the Azure Firewall and went to the "Rules" tab.
I created a new application rule collection.
I added a rule that allowed only outbound traffic to www.bing.com.
Task 5: Configure a Network Rule
In the same "Rules" tab of the Azure Firewall, I created a new network rule collection.
I added a rule to allow external DNS server lookups, specifying the necessary IP addresses and ports.
Task 6: Configure DNS Servers
I updated the DNS settings of the virtual network to use the external DNS servers.
I ensured that the DNS queries were routed through the firewall by updating the DNS server settings of the virtual machines in each subnet.
Task 7: Test the Firewall
I logged into the virtual machine in the workload subnet.
I verified that I could access www.bing.com but no other websites.
I checked that DNS lookups for external sites were successful, confirming that the firewall was working as intended.
Advantages to Any Organization
Enhanced Security: By controlling both inbound and outbound traffic, the organization significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
Centralized Management: Azure Firewall provides a centralized way to manage network security, making it easier to implement and enforce security policies.
Compliance: Helps in meeting regulatory requirements by ensuring that network traffic is monitored and controlled.
Scalability: Azure Firewall is highly scalable, making it suitable for organizations of any size.
Cost-Effective: Reduces the need for multiple security appliances, lowering overall infrastructure costs.
Implementing these steps helps ensure that network security policies are robust and well-managed, keeping the organization's data and systems safe.
